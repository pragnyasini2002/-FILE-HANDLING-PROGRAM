# Project Overview: File Handling Program Using C
# Objective:
  The primary objective of this project is to develop a C-based application that demonstrates efficient file handling operations, including file creation, reading, writing,    appending, and modification. The project aims to enhance understanding of file input/output functions in C and their practical applications in real-world scenarios like      data storage, retrieval, and management.

# Project Description:
  This project involves building a console-based file handling system in the C programming language. It provides a user-friendly menu-driven interface that allows users to     perform various operations on text files. The user can:

# Create a new file
# Open and read contents of a file
# Write data to a file
# Append new data to an existing file
# Delete a file

 All functionalities are implemented using standard file handling functions in C such as fopen(), fclose(), fprintf(), fscanf(), fgets(), fputs().

# Key Features:
  Menu-driven interface for ease of use
  Basic validation for file operations (e.g., file not found, read/write errors)
  Use of pointers and file pointers to manage file streams

# Technologies Used:
  Programming Language: C
  Compiler: GCC Compiler
  Development Environment: Code:: Visual Studio Code

# Learning Outcomes:
  Understanding of file streams and file modes (r, w, a, r+, etc.)
  Proficiency in handling user input/output through files
  Use of error handling in file operations
  Improved coding practices in C programming, particularly in using functions and control structures.
